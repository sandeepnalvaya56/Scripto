# Scripto
This repository contains my scripting efforts in Unix, Python, BATch and VBA etc.

I am into Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence field with an ETL developer profile.
I am currently working on Informatica Power Center 9.x tool, with Oracle as our DB and Autosys(Command Line) as scheduler.
I have also worked in HDFS, Hive, Oozie, Sqoop and Pig. The system was automated using Python scripting.
I like to automate stuff using bash(Unix) and BATch(Windows) and Python scripting.
